# brain-tumor-detector
This project is a web app where users can upload a brain MRI image and get a prediction from a machine learning model if it contains a tumor or not.
This is only the main files that were edited and not the entire project.
This is because due to the size of the Python packages that needed to be installed for the machine learning model to preprocess the image, the project is too large to be uploaded to Github.
